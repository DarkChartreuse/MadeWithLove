## Usage

> Initial Postgres Database Setup

- If you don't have Postgres.app, point to http://postgresapp.com/, download,
and install the app
- Open Postgres.app from your Applications folder
- Click on the Postgres elephant icon on the menu bar and select 'Open psql'
to start the Postgres instance (a psql terminal window should open up)
- In the window, create the database table by typing:
```sh
CREATE DATABASE mwl_db;
```

###Elastic search
- Download elasticsearch zip (https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch)
- Unzip the file
- Copy *elasticsearch.yml* file from mwl root folder into the config folder of the unzipped file
- To start elasticsearch, in the terminal, go to the root folder of the unzipped file and type: 
```sh
./bin/elasticsearch & hit enter
```
- This will start elastic search on localhost:9200 

####Seed elastic search for meals generated by chefs
- From your application folder, copy "meals.json" file
- Go to the root folder of the unzipped elasticsearch file
- Paste the copied file into the folder
- To drop the data run the following command from anywhere in the terminal:  
```sh
curl -XDELETE 'http://localhost:9200/_all'
```
- In the terminal, from inside the elasticsearch folder run the following command: 
```sh
curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/mwl/meal/_bulk?pretty' --data-binary "@meals.json";
```
